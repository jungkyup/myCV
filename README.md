MyCV
=====================================

## About

This is my Curriculum Vitae, made using `XeTeX`. 

## Installation

To install `XeTeX`, run on OSX

    $ brew install https://raw.github.com/gist/3293330/fbc637e8632ac78450f4568626a1120177276fd6/texlive.rb

This will install a copy of `XeTeX`, and the latex packages

In order to compile this, I run

    $ xetex cv.tex
